 <br>
 In this course assignment, I have implemented a custom set data structure using vectors in C++. 
 <br>
 I utilized the vector data structure in C++ to create a custom set implementation. 
 <br>
 The additional functions added to the set enhance its capabilities beyond the basic set operations.
